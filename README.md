### What I learned

How to use the article element for grouping components, I initially went with div tags but ran into a wall when I wanted to group things side by side.


### Continued development

The last two challenges were quite similar, that you create a contained component within the center of the page, though this time I had to consider a desktop layout.
I didn't quite get close to the design as I've done in the past, but I didn't want to spend so much time on the one challenge.
